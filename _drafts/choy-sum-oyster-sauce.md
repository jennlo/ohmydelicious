This recipe requires no previous cooking experience. Trust me. My younger brother, who only know how to make packaged ramen noodles and fried eggs knows how to make this.

Here's what you need.

Ingredients:
1 Package of Choy Sum
1 Tbs of Canola Oil (or Virgin Olive Oil)
Chinese Oyster Sauce

Preparation Time: 5 mins
Cooking Time: 8 mins
Servings: 4 people

Prepare the choy sum for washing. Separate the leaves from the stalks and pick out the yellow flowers from the leaves. If the pieces are too long, break them into halves. It will help cook the vegetable quicker and easier. Once the choy sum is broken into pieces, wash thoroughly.

In a large wok, fill half of it with water and pour in the canola oil (or virgin olive oil). Bring it to boil.

Once the water is boiling, put only the stalks in and cook for 3 mins on medium-high heat. The stalks of the vegetable is thick, so it will require more time to cook through.

Put the leaves into the wok. Use a pair of chopsticks or wooden spoon to carefully overturn the stalks and leaves, so then the leaves are under the boiling water. Cover, cook for 5 mins, then plate.

For the final seasoning, zigzag some Chinese oyster sauce onto the choy sum. There's no need for salt or sugar when cooking the choy sum, because the oyster sauce is all the seasoning you'll need. Just keep it simple!

This recipe is great for green leaf lettuce or iceberg lettuce. Just replace the choy sum for the other. The steps are similar to the recipe above. Feel free to experiment with your dishes. Enjoy and happy cooking!
