If you are visiting Taipei for the first time, you  must try the Din Tai Fung restaurant. It was so good that we went twice during our seven day trip.

First, we went to the original location near Dongmen, then we went to their second location at Taipei 101 on another day. They're know for their steamed pork dumplings and exceptional service. The servers are very nice and well mannered. For the ladies, they provided a basket for my bag and jacket. That's just super thoughtful of them.

On both occasions, we ordered the steamed pork dumplings. The best part about them is their thin dumpling wrapping which doesn't break easily. I've tried the same dish at different restaurants before, but this is by far the best one I've had.

Other dishes on their menu is quite exceptional as well. I'm really into spicy food so I tried their dumplings in chilli oil. In the Asian culture, we're really big on our noodles. If that's what you're into, be sure to try out some of the noodles on the menu.

Oh, one last thing. If you're looking to visit, GET THERE EARLY! The long line-up is normal for both locations, but definitely worth it. Enjoy!
