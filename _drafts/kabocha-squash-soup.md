Do you know what's one dish that can keep you warm on a cold windy night while keeping you full? Soup.

This is my favourite go-to soup recipe when I'm on a hurry and don't know what to cook. It's full of vitamin C. I prefer to use the kabocha squash since the carb percentage is lower than potatoes, but the traditional recipe is with potatoes and carrots.

I encourage people to experiment with different ingredients along this recipe.

Preparation Time: 15 mins
Cooking Time: 1.5 - 2 hours
Servings: 4 - 6 people

Ingredients:
1/2 of Kabocha Squash
3 - 4 Tomatoes
2 Corns
2 - 3 pieces of Pork Neck Bone
Salt
Water

Prepare a small pot with cold water, then put the pork neck bones and 1 tsp of salt in the water. Bring it to boil with no covers. While you're waiting for the water to boil, cut the kabocha squash in half and wash all the vegetables. (You'll only need half the squash. The other half can be used for another time.)

[Back to the neck bones] At boil, you will see some foamy brown bubbles lying on top of the water. This is the blood impurities from the bones. Turn off the stove and drain the bones in a metal colander, then run it under cold water to wash off the remaining impurities and set it aside.

In a medium pot, fill it with 2/3 cold water and bring it to boil. While you're waiting the water to boil, prepare and cut your vegetables. Keep your hands busy at all times to make things more efficient!

Snap the corns in half. Cut the tomatoes in quarters and remove the top core where the stem meets -- this is where the pesticides accumulate the most. Cut the kabocha squash in medium pieces -- this avoid them from breaking apart too easily.

Once the water is boiling. Carefully put the pork neck bones into the pot and let it boil for 10 mins.

Slowly put the vegetables into the pot in this order: corn, squash, tomatoes. It's optional, but you can first put half the tomatoes and squash into the pot along with the corn, then the other half an hour later. Once the first half of the vegetables are in the pot, lower the heat to medium (4 - 5).

You don't really have to watch the soup as it boils, but you might want to stick close to the kitchen since the stove is on. Bring your tablet, phone or computer over to the dining table while the soup is cooking. Or you could take this time to make other dishes.

The reason why you might want to split the portions of tomatoes and squash is because they will break apart easily during the cooking process. If you like to eat the tomatoes and squash as a side dish, splitting the portions will prevent that from happening.

The last thing to remember before serving is to put 2 tsp of salt into the soup. Oh, don't forget to taste! Put more or less salt up to your taste.

Voila! It's done! Scoop and serve! The vegetables and pork neck bones can be a separate dish if you like.

I love making soup because I think they're the easiest thing to make. It may take a while to boil, but if you start in the afternoon or the night before, it'll be ready by dinner time. I often leave the soup on the stove overnight. But only for one night.
