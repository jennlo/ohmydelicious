Oh Mother's day. It's probably the most busiest day of the year for the restaurant industry other than the Christmas season. Most people would choose to do the traditional buffet brunch, but I've decided to try something new. I may say it's even better than buffet food.

First off, this brunch outing was not with my own mother. I celebrated Mother's Day a day early with my mom. This was with my boyfriend's mom and his family.

Let's just say, it's amazing!

The Oakwood is a Canadian bistro and lounge located in Vancouver's Kitsilano. Their food philosophy is focused on fresh, house-made dishes crafted from locally sourced products. From the breads and pastas to the butchery and sauces, all products are made in-house with quality and consistency. At the bar, you will find an excellent selection of local craft beers, hand crafted cocktails and a hand chosen wine list.

The restaurant is a great place for dinner and drinks, but I've decided to try out their brunch for Mother's Day. Normally they do not do reservations for Sunday brunch, but Mother's Day calls for an exception. I'm happy we didn't have to wait long. The server were very friendly and attentive, letting us know the specials for the day as soon as she sat us down.

I've ordered the maple confit pork belly with scrambled eggs, home fries and toast ($12). My guy got the steak and eggs sunny side up with home fries, fresh tomatoes and chimichurri ($16). For that affordable price, I say the portions was more than enough. I was so full, I couldn't even finish my home fries. Although the pork belly was a little bit too salty for my liking, but overall everything was delicious. I got a bite of the steak from my boyfriend's plate. Let's just say, it was a great piece of steak!

Now for the drinks. I totally forgot to take a picture of it - I know, I know. How could I? I ordered The Oakwood Caesar, which may be the best caesar that I've tasted by far. They offer a selection of different types of caesars mix with a pre-selected list of liquor. For example, you could get it with a shot of tequila instead of the vodka. I stuck with the classic vodka, but the selection of liquor is not the best part yet. The best about Oakwood's caesars is its mix of a special in-house sauce and horseradish to give it a unique kick to the drink.

Trust me. I wanted more! I'm sure that I'll be back for more of that caesar, and perhaps next time I'll try out cocktail with a bit of tequila in it. I'm a Bloody Mary kind of girl, but ever since this caesar, I kind of fell in love with caesars too. I still prefer the tomato juice instead of the clamato, but I guess I just found a liking to it now. Oh, I'll remember to take a photo next time I'm back. :)

Where's your favourite brunch spot? I'd love to hear from you!
