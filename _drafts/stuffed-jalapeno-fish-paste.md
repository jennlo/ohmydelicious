I love jalapeños! I learned this particular dish from my grandfather. He used to make this dish all the time for our family dinners. It's a little bit more work, but trust me, it's worth it! If you're into spicy, this will give a nice twist to your everyday jalapeño peppers. The fish paste is a nice compliment to the spiciness of the peppers.

Here we go!

Prep time: 20 mins
Cook time:10 - 12mins
Servings: 4 people

Ingredients:
8 Jalapeño Peppers
1/2 Portion of Dace Fish Paste
Canola Oil
Corn Starch
Maggi Seasoning Sauce

Wash the jalapeño peppers and cut the tops off (just a little, don't cut off too much). Cut the jalapeños in half to create the cup for the fish paste. Remove the seeds and the white veins, then rinse under water. Those are the real devils that make the pepper so hot. If you like spicy, you can try leaving some of the veins in.

Sprinkle some corn starch on the insides of the jalapeños. This will help the fish paste stick to the jalapeños. Once done, use a metal spoon to fill the jalapeño cups with fish paste. Make sure the fish paste is pressed evenly into the cups and remove any excess fish paste if necessary.

**Warning! Do not touch your eyes once you've handled jalapeño peppers. It WILL burn! Wash your hands thoroughly after handling the peppers.

In a non-stick pan, heat up the canola oil on medium high heat (around 7-8 on the dial is fine). If you want to test if the oil is heated, simply use a wooden spatula and see if it bubbles when it touches the oil.

Place the pepper cups into the pan with the fish paste facing down. Turn the heat down to medium (around 5-6 on the dial) to avoid burning. Turn over the peppers when the fish paste turns golden brown. Keep turning them to avoid burning. This will also allow them to cook evenly.

Gently pour a small portion of Maggi seasoning sauce over the pepper when the fish paste is turned facing up. The sauce will bring flavour and slightly a bit of salt to peppers, so please don't pour a lot. Cover the pan and turn off the heat to allow the seasoning sauce soak into the peppers for 30 seconds.

It is now ready to serve! Bon appetite!

In the photos I was cooking for two, so please adjust to your number of servings. This dish could also be done with small green peppers (which are occasionally available at local Chinese supermarkets), or you could use the regular green, red, orange or yellow peppers. Those are not spicy, but they're also kind of hard to shape the cup. I like the crunchiness of the jalapeños, plus they make great cups for stuffing.

Try out whichever you like and let me know what you think. Happy cooking! :)
