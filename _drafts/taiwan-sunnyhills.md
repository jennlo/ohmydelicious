I believe this experience is a great example to show how a great experience can definitely close the sales that you need. The smallest details counts

Here’s the story.

My boyfriend and I was hoping to buy some gifts from Taiwan for our families, so we decided to get Taiwan’s famous pineapple cakes. We were recommended by a friend to visit this place called Sunny Hills near ShongShan area because he said their pineapple cakes are the best. So we went. As we arrived upon the store front, it does not occur to me that it was a store at all. It looks more like a tea house and the overall design was very calm and soothing.

When we entered, an attendant asked if we were here to have tea. We said we were there to buy some pineapple cakes as gifts. She attended us to sit at a table while she brought each of us a neat tray of one pineapple cake and a cup of tea. Immediately I felt very warm deep inside. It was such a nice thing that they did. The overall experience was excellent because there was not one moment where the attendants was trying to sell us anything at all. The selling was all done innately through the tasting and in the experience.

While we were relaxing and enjoying our pineapple cake and tea, we also observed how others reacted and experienced what we were experiencing. The moment a guest finished with their tea and pineapple cake, she walked towards to cash register and bought approximately four boxes of pineapple cakes. During the entire experience, the attendants did not try to sell her anything but only to attend her for the tasting. They did not give an intention to obligate anyone to buy anything even if they have tasted the cake. They left the buying decision to the customers, which I thought was the best selling technique.

The experience definitely drove us to buying some pineapple cakes for our families. We ended up buying four boxes ourselves after going through such a neat experience. This example best showcase how other businesses can learn to sell their products through experience rather than push promoting and other tricks to push customers to buy.

By far, I have shared this story and this experience to many of my friends and family. Have you ever had an experience similar to this? I would love to hear about them.
