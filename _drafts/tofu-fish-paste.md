I'm not a big fan of tofu, but if it is mixed with something flavourful, that's an exception. Here's an easy dish that won't take you a lot of effort AND it's delicious. It's perfect served with rice.

Okay. Let's get started!

Prep time: 10 mins
Cook time: 15 mins
Servings: 4 People

Ingredients:
1/2 Brick of Tofu
1/2 Portion of Dace Fish Paste
1 Tsp Ground White Pepper

The tofu I used was medium firm bought from the local Chinese supermarket. You can also find the dace fish paste at your local Chinese supermarket near the fresh seafood section. Most tofu and fish paste are pre-packaged and the portions are good for two meals, so plan your meals for the week in advance when you go out for your groceries.

Cut the tofu brick in half and store the other half in the fridge. Same goes for the fish paste.

Cut the tofu into small cubes. This will allow for easy smashing and mixing later on.

In a separate bowl, mix the tofu cubes and fish paste together using a large spoon or wooden spatula. Be sure to mix evenly and smash the tofu into the fish paste. Once it's blended together, mix in the ground white pepper. Again, be sure to mix evenly. Oh, and have some fun doing it!

Now that everything is mixed. Transfer the mixture into a metal round pan. I like to use metal because it traps the heat once it's ready to serve, but ceramic or glass is okay as well.

Press the mixture evenly in the pan just like what I had in the photo here.

To cook the dish, you'll need a steamer. I used a large wide pot and an elevated steaming rack (found in most Chinese supermarkets). I put enough water in the large pot so that it just reaches the rim of the rack. If you happen to have a double boiler or a legit steamer, that works too.

Bring the water to a boil on high heat. Put the dish on top of the rack, then cover the pot. Steam for 15 mins then it's ready to serve.

You'll notice the fish paste have expanded and it is no longer sticky. Serve with rice.

I normally cook two other dishes and sometimes make soup along with this dish. I cook for four people most of the time, so please adjust the portion accordingly if you're cooking for less or more people. I hope you enjoy this dish as well as the process of making it. Sometimes I get lazy or don't know what to really cook, so this dish is easy and simple to get the job done. Let me know what you think.
