I'm sure most of us have been to Las Vegas at least once in their lifetime. Yes. You might think Las Vegas is only about the night clubs, pool parties and gambling, but there's more than just that.

I believe great food is what drives tourists to visit a destination. It is the main attraction that I plan my trips around -- simply because I love to eat.

For some of you, these places might not be anything special but I'll share them with you anyway. For those that haven't been to Las Vegas, I recommend to try out these places when you're feeling hungry -- or hungover from a good night out.

Earl of Sandwiches at Planet Hollywood

These are not your everyday sandwiches made by your mom or dad -- which could leave you hating sandwiches -- but they are delicious and gourmet. Earl of Sandwiches have several locations across the United States. I just so happen to be in Las Vegas when I first tried them after an amazing pool party at Wet Republic.

Aside from their huge selection of gourmet sandwiches, they also serve wraps, salads and artisan soups. I had their signature sandwich, The Original 1762, made with roasted beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce. ($6.49)

In N' Out Burger

Nothing beats a cheap good greasy cheeseburger. The infamous In-n-Out Burger ARE better than the ones at the McDonald's by your neighbourhood corner. One discretion though -- they are super greasy! And you probably will feel very heavy and bloated for the rest of your day.

If you haven't tried them before, just give it a try. I'm not a huge burger person, but I do make an exception for one of these whenever I do get the chance to visit. They have locations in various states across the country -- mostly in California.

The following are not my photos -- I was too hungry and forgot to take pictures. But these photos does give you a good idea what to look for.

I had the Cheeseburger ($2.30) and fries with animal spread ($1.60). You got to get the Animal Fries! In the photo is the Double Double ($3.35) and fries with animal spread.

Holsteins at Cosmopolitan

Like I've said before, I'm not a huge burger person. But I do make exceptions. I recommend to give Holstein's a try. And no, I didn't eat BOTH servings of burgers -- I shared it with my boyfriend.

I ordered the Ahi Sliders ($15) with substituted yam fries ($2) and my man had the The Fun-Ghi with regular fries ($17).

I'll be honest. Try the Fun-Ghi. It's better than the Ahi Sliders that I had. The beef patty was grilled to perfection -- medium rare, just like what we asked for -- and the truffle, portabella mushroom and caramelized onions combo was just amazing. Don't get me wrong. The sliders were great too, but just not to die for. It does make a good choice for those who's looking for a healthier choice.

For a nice finish to our meal, we ordered a spiked milkshake, Chocolate Covered Strawberry ($13), as dessert. It's as good as it looks! They have a nice selection of milkshakes -- both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.

To all burger lovers, where would you recommend for the best burgers? I'd like to know and expand my exceptions to different amazing burgers around the world.
