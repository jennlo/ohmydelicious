I started Ohmydelicious! simply because I love to cook and eat. I've been cooking at home more often ever since I've been laid off from my job. To save some money during my job hunting period, I've cut down my spending from eating out (with some exceptions to birthdays and family gatherings). I've spend more on groceries and cooking my meals at home. This have cut down my expenses by half.

I also live with my boyfriend and his parents. He's an entrepreneur launching his software company very soon. That also means he doesn't have a stable income, yet. Desperate time comes to desperate measures. This means I'll just have to get creative in the kitchen.

That's not all. His mom have diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and his dad have gout and high blood pressure. This made it very difficult when we're eating out. Being traditional Chinese parents, they love their fats, oil and carbs. It made it almost impossible to eat healthy when eating out. This is also why I've been cooking at home more often.

I've came to know more about the nutritional diets that would help lower the risks of his parents' health condition. Overtime, I've learned to select quality produce and meat at the grocery store.

I've created Ohmydelicious!  to share my cooking recipes and the tips and tricks to picking groceries and saving money when you're broke to eat out all the time. I have a lot of friends who don't really know how to cook or don't have the time to do so. The recipes I share are made for those with little to no cooking experience. It's easy to follow and doesn't take a lot of time to make. This is the sole purpose of Ohmydelicious!, to educate!

Ohmydelicious! is also a food blog with restaurant reviews and travel. I do splurge occasionally. I love trying out different restaurants around my residing city as well as when I travel. This is my way of sharing my food adventures to those who's interested to visit those places one day.

I hope to help other food lovers to explore a lot more food options through Ohmydelicious!.

Thank you for reading!
