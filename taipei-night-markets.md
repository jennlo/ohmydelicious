During my seven day trip in Taipei, I would say I've spent almost every night at one of Taipei's famous night markets.  The nearest to where we stayed was Raoche St. Night Market. Here you can find many local delicacies that Taiwan is famous for. I had the peppery pork bun. Aside from it being delicious, the most interesting thing is seeing how they made it. It's baked in a neat looking charcoal stove which is circular in shape, where the raw bun is slapped onto the side of the stove.

Taiwan is known for their fried stinky tofu, so if you haven't tried one, you're missing out. The smell can be very strong for some people, but if you can get over it and take a bite, you'll slowly fall in love with it (I promise).  I couldn't help to get seconds just before we leave the night market that night.

There's so much to eat, so do make room to try out other dishes as you walk through the markets. I do recommend to bring friends with you to share the food. To make room for dessert, I shared the egg omelette roll stuffed with cheese and corn, okonomiyaki with tuna toppings, and pork ribs in herbal medicine soup with my boyfriend.

I've never been to Taiwan before, so it was nice to have a friend who's local and know what's the best food around. He took us to Taipei's largest night market, Shilin Night Market. Many of the delicacies are similar in every night market, but only the locals would know which ones are the best. We didn't end up eating to same things as we did the other night, but we did try a lot more other stuff.

Again, I would recommend to bring friends along with you to share the food. Just to give you an idea, the chicken fillet we ordered was as big as my face (I'm serious - you can check it out in the photos below). I think the best we had from Shilin Night Market was the Beijing lamb skewers and the tofu dessert.

The last night market I visited was Jingmei Night Market. If you're a skewer kind of person, you will love it here. Skewers everywhere, but make sure you drink some herbal tea for detox later. Jingmei Night Market is also known for their Eight Ingredient Shaved Ice. This is not regular shaved ice with fruits and syrup. The toppings include a variety of beans, grass jellies and flavoured glutinous balls.

It'll be nice to visit again someday. Perhaps next time, I'll explore Tai Chung and Tai Nan.

Have anyone visited Tai Chung and Tai Nan? If so, it'll be awesome to hear what you love about your trip.
